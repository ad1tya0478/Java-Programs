// threads - A thread is a small unit of a process that can run code independently. we use threads to run mutiple tasks like downloading files while playing music.
// there are multiple threads in one process/task
// we use threads To keep apps responsive (like a UI thread handling clicks while background threads load data).
// a thread is also the smallest unit of execution in a process/task. 
class A extends Thread {
    public void run(){
        for(int i = 1; i<=10;i++){

        // obj1.show();

        // start() - When you call start(), the thread moves from being just an idea (new) to ready for battle (runnable). The JVM then schedules it, and the threadâ€™s run() method begins executing on its own path.
