      // Binary search - Binary search is all about divide and conquer. the arrar must be sorted(ascending/descending). If it's unsorted binary search is useless. First we put two pointers in the array, LEFT - start of the array, RIGHT - end of the array. Then we find the middle - mid = (LEFT + RIGHT) / 2, and then we compare the arr[mid] with the target.
      
      // 3 possible outcomes - 1. if arr[mid] == target -> found, return index. 2. if arr[mid] < target -> target is grater, so ignore the left half, search in the right half. 3. if arr[mid] > target -> target is smaller, so ignore the right half, search in the left half
